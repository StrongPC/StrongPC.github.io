## Who are you? 
>We are a small CPU manufacture from Iran, Islamic Republic of. We work on simple ALU's and CPU IC's. 

## What problem do you want to solve?
>There's a problem, that there's no good implementation of free and open source CPUs. We're going to create one, largely based on MIPS and ARM architectures, and also we're attempting to create a unique architecture, close to MIPS and ARM. 

## Why do you think that it's a problem?
>Current non-free and closed source CPUs (and at all, hardware) may have backdoors (Which we don't like at all!) and with backdoors, they can spy you, and collect your information. 
Also, there's no local manufacture in Iran (and in larger scale, middle east and north Africa), so we want to support this area. 

## How are you going to solve the problem?
>By design and implementation of LadyBug CPU and ALUs. We let users see blue prints and HDL codes. Also, they can order actuall hardware, and we let them know how we converted HDL codes to a chip, and this is why users will trust us. 

## Will StrongPC be a complete computer?
>We try our best to make a computer from scratch, not only CPU. But, as we work on computer architecture and organization, so currently, we only work on CPU, specially ALU and I/O system.
