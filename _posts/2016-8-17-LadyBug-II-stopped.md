title: LadyBug II development stopped
---

According to the complexity of LadyBug II CPU, we decided to stop its development process, and for now, we're going to port our first ALU to a usable CPU, with some new ICs and devices. 
Also, as "LadyBug" name is very common and taken by a lot of other projects/startups, we've decided to choose a new name for our project. 
More details will be published soon!
