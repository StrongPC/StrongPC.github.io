title: Project Updates & Future Plans
--- 

This is about one year we started working on our project. This post is a report of project updates and all we done in last year. 

* [Design and Implementation of Our ALU](https://github.com/StrongPC/ladybugcpu) 
* [Design and Implementation of our Display Driver](https://github.com/StrongPC/ladybug-display-driver) 
* [Design and Implementation of a BCD to Decimal Decoder](https://github.com/StrongPC/ladybug-decoder) 

Those were all *logical* simulations, designs and implementations we've done in last year. These are our designs, which are came more on digital electronics and actuall hardware : 

* [TTL/RTL Implementation of Logical Circuits](http://strongpc.ir/2016/07/17/Transistor-implementation.html) 
* [CMOS Design](https://github.com/StrongPC/cmos) 

And, this project was designed and implemented as a *side-project* in StrongPC. 

* [8 bit programmable computer](https://github.com/StrongPC/8bitProgComputer). 

## Future Plans 

StrongPC, actually has these plans for the second year of activity : 

* Changing web hosting service, from *Mihanwebhost* (Iranian hosting service provider) to *Github pages*. Because we use `jekyll` on our website, and github pages doesn't need generating final website. It will be automatically generated. 
* In this year, we will focus on *hardware design and implementation* instead of *logical* designs. We've done logical studies, designs and implementations before. Now, it's time for making a real and working hardware product. 
* The most important decision we've made for the new year, is filming and documenting all phases of our physical implemntations. This will help us for future uses, and people who need that.
