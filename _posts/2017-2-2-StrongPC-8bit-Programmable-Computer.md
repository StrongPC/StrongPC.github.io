title: StrongPC 8bit Programmable Computer
---

We were working on our project with the goal of "Programmable Computer" and then, we found that we can use Read-Only Memory "ROM" for programming our ALU's. Also, we implemented all instructions we needed using minimum number of gates. This computer can do AND, OR, NAND, NOR, ADD and SUB. For more information, you can visit our [github repository](https://github.com/StrongPC/8bitProgComputer).
