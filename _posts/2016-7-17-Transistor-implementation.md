title: Transistor implementation
---
After computer simulation of ALU, we're going to make an implementation of our ALU using transistors and integrated circuits. This is our first labratory implementation of logic gates (using transistors) :

Also, at the first step, we made a 2x4 decoder using these gates:

But, as soon as possible, we'll switch to use 74 Series integrated circuits for labratory implementation, because they're cheaper and better than transistor circuits.
